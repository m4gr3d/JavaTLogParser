# JavaTLogParser

This is helpful java code that will parse TLog files to readable messages.

You can run the code the following ways: <br/>
1. You can open the project in Eclipse or Intellij and run Main.java with a list of directories as the argument. <br/>
2. Additionally, you can run the jar file directly <br/>

`java -jar out/artifacts/TLogParser.jar file1 file2`

You can modify the filter to only look for certain messages. All changes should be made in `src/com/o3dr/tlog/Main.java`
